# SpotNET
SpotNET is a (experimental) lightning software with the abillity to softpatch virtual dimmer adresses to real DMX adresses.

The long-term goal of this project is to provide a ligthing software that meet semi-professional requirements as seen in smaller theatres.

Because this is a hobby project of mine, development could stall at some times. There is also no garantuee that this project will ever reach its long-term goal.
